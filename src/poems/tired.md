Thereâ€™s a heaviness  
That comes with living

The kind that sits on your chest  
And in your bones  
Dark icicles hanging  
From the fabric of your being  
Pulling at your skin  
Wrinkles gouging out the  
Worries and stress  
Of every day

The sensation of having  
Nearly every possibility  
And yet  
Knowing how to achieve none

The future is hidden  
In fog and curtains  
Hanging from every  
Decision tree  
A mind can dream

I am so tired  
From the icicles  
And the fog  
And the curtains

I wish for everything to finally be   
Clear  
But know that this will make everything  
Boring  
So instead I am just  
Tired

To bear witness  
To all the inner workings  
Of a player’s mind  
As they create a character’s response  

To their long lost child  
Of 15 years  
And their ex-wife  
Who they should have never seen again  

To bear witness  
To the strategic response  
That a tower with no doors or windows  
Raises from a group  

Especially when  
A flaming, nasally skull  
Has just been killed  
But they know it will rise from the dead  

To bear witness  
To the secret whispers  
Of a player with a plan  
For their character to run away  

While the rest of the group  
Merrily jokes and jabs  
At each other  
As they mosey along the deep forest road  

To bear witness  
To the sacred notes  
And scribbled papers  
Full of gathered and lost ideas  

That will take  
One group or another  
From their humble beginnings   
And into the  

Breathing  
Dying  
Glistening  
Flaming  
Swirling  
Still  

World that awaits

Back before time began  
Before bangs  
And clangs  
And clocks  
And docks  
And dings

There was a deafened silence  
An ultra black void  
Filled with nothing  
And yet embodying everything  
In a tiny pin prick  
A spot of white hot light

All around this light  
There is blackness  
Cold, and desolate  
Like endless inky skies in winter  
Or an unimaginably deep well

And at the center  
Like at the center of earth  
Is steaming, roiling matter  
Mattering so much  
Yet being so little

There is no sensation  
No taste  
No touch  
Soundless  
Until a ripping  
Roaring  
Thundering and cataclysmic shock  
Runs through all of the dark  
And springs into life   
Light  
And sound  
And heat

So hot and bright  
Emulsifying everything in whiteness  
Creating radiation  
And dust  
And warmth  

Cats and trees  
Air and water and soil  
People and emotions  
All spring from light and heat

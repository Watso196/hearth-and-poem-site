I had a giant garden  
Full of hand-made raised beds  
With woodchip walkways  
And personally designed trellises  

It was made to withstand  
Rain and hail and frost  
But I didnâ€™t anticipate  
The weeds that grew from the edges  

They took over  
Reaching grubby claws  
Into my carefully selected soil  
And choking out my tomatoes  

I have a massive garden  
With no raised beds  
No trellises or walkways  
It is an empty patch of land  

Sometimes to finish  
You have to start again

Hips swaying in the cold breeze  
Of a winter evening  
Backlit by an apartment entry  
Empty of others

Eyes cast upward  
At the night sky  
Breath hanging heavily  
In the cold night air  
As you listen to me ramble  
About the stars and planets  
And how we are both   
So small

Laying on the soft carpet  
Of a near-empty apartment  
Talking about almost nothing  
And yet everything

These are the first memories  
I have of perhaps  
The most influential woman  
In my life

I am so fortunate  
To say that these memories  
Happened years ago  
And also  
Havenâ€™t stopped happening since

title: The Guitar I Got In Sevilla That Reminds Me Of Myself

I have moved  
A tiny guitar  
That I bought in Sevilla  
Close to a dozen times

Each time I’ve moved it  
I placed it on a stand  
Made to fit the guitar  
Perfectly

And each time  
I placed that guitar  
Upon its perfect stand  
It would fall over

Eventually I tried so hard  
To adjust the stand  
That I broke it  
In half

The guitar still sits   
On my bookshelf  
In my office  
Where I can see it

And it still falls  
From time to time  
When the door slams  
Or the fan is set too high

But overall  
It stays upright  
Showcasing its “Sevilla” script  
And filling otherwise empty space

I feel like this guitar sometimes  
Brought up on a stand  
That didn’t quite fit  
And always falling over  
When I got rid  
Of my imperfect stand  
I stopped falling as much  
But still make mistakes

I hope I’m as beautiful  
And not filling empty space

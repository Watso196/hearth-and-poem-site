My beard is soft

A fuzzy metaphor  
Describing my masculinity  
On display;  
Unmissable  

I am a soft child  
Full of emotional wonder  
And the feeling of being  
Immature and unmanly  

My beard is curly 

Unlike men in movies  
With straight, long hairs  
Mine is  
Frumpy and full of  
Volumetric anxiety

I am a queer  
Antisocial mess of a   
Somewhat-man  
Flailing his way through  
The puddle of life

My beard is patchy

Like the patchiness in my  
Sense of pride  
When I brush my soft beard  
Each morning

But I still brush it  
And I will tomorrow, too

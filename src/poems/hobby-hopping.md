I fall in and out of love  
With my hobbies consistently  

When my fire for sewing is embers  
My passion for gardening is aflame  

When I discover a great video game  
My hiking plans will go on hold  

What a beautiful power  
To be able to drop things  
And pick them back up again  
Without breaking them

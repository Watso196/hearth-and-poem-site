There’s a me  
Who never worried about  
Being judged for having tits 

There’s a me  
Who never got called gay  
By fifth grade little shits  

There’s a me  
Who never grappled with  
Feeling wrong as a “girl”  

There’s a me  
Who never worried about  
Being accepted by the world  

There’s a me  
Who talks openly about  
Being trans with neighbors  

There’s a me  
Who was never put through  
Prejudice by religious haters  

There’s a me  
Who never thought about  
Fleeing my own country  

There’s a me  
Who never worried that  
My body would make someone dump me  

There’s a me  
Who had no anxiety when  
Getting pulled over in a car  

There’s a me  
Who never took hormones  
And probably didn’t make it this far  

There’s a me  
Who never accepted that  
My gender identity was real  

There’s a me  
Who could have resorted  
To being prejudiced with zeal  

There are many mes  
That could exist  
Given different situations  

But I’m proud of  
The me who exists now  
For pursuing transformation

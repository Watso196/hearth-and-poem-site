May your love be a language  
You never stop learning.  
Not fluent—  
but curious.  
Willing to ask,  
willing to answer,  
willing to hear the same sentence  
a thousand different ways,  
and a million separate times.

May your days stretch long and calm—  
where silence is shared  
but meaning is not missing.  
And may your nights hold noise—  
laughter and warmth,  
with each of your words  
fully heard.

I hope you never forget  
that “I’m fine” is not a finish line.  
That “nothing’s wrong”  
can mean  
everything.  
That guessing gets you nowhere  
but asking  
gets you home.

I hope you stay  
each other’s home.  
Even when the paint chips.  
Even when one of you  
feels slow  
and the other  
feels late.  
Even when love  
has lost its voice  
but  
not its actions.

You are not the same  
and that is the point.  
You are not matching pieces—  
you’re a pattern  
only visible  
when side by side.

So may you always protect  
the peace of your partner,  
learn which battles  
don’t need winning,  
and which quiets  
don’t mean “go away.”

To the quiet and the loud,  
the patient and the bold,  
may you always  
balance each other out.
